        "description": "Email is a significant component of day-to-day business (and personal) activity and can be accessible not only on corporate desktop computers but also mobile devices, including personal devices, which introduces new vulnerabilities and has become a critical part of enterprise cybersecurity efforts. Email messages and activity logs across these endpoints can provide critical insights into communication activity that might warrant more in-depth investigation. For example, attackers may be sending emails with malicious code attached in a file or embedding a link to a website where the malicious code is hosted, targeting recipients, in order to obtain intellectual property or personally identifiable information/personal data, as well as command and control. In addition, internal threats leveraging email may include transmitting data to external email accounts.",

Unlike traditional client-server or web applications, telephony and other communications applications have strict requirements on network quality of service, latency and packet loss, making service quality and reliability much more sensitive to network conditions and server responsiveness. Traditional POTS has conditioned people to expect immediate dial tone when picking up the phone and be intolerant of noise, echo or other problems that can plague IP telephony; as such, the systems and supporting infrastructure require careful monitoring and management to assure quality and reliability. Voice over IP protocol refers to several methods for transmitting real-time audio (and now video) information over an IP-based data network. Unlike traditional phone systems using dedicated, point-to-point circuits, VoIP applications use packet-based networks to carry real-time audio streams that are interspersed with other Ethernet data traffic. Since TCP packets may be delivered out of order due to data loss and retransmission, VoIP includes features to buffer and reassemble a stream. Similarly, VoIP packets are usually tagged with quality of service (QoS) headers to prioritize their delivery through the network.",
