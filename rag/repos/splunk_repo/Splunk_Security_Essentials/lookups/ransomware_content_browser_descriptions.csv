stage,Initial access,"<p>In the first phase of the attack the attacker is simply looking to gain a foothold in the organisation’s network, wherever that might be. In the majority of incidents we see initial access is gained in one of three ways. Each of these pathways requires slightly different defensive controls to protect against.</p>                   <p>No matter which pathway the attacker attempts to gain initial access, our goal is to have controls that will let us detect that activity and prevent it. At all stages of an attack we cannot stop what we cannot detect. This is why logging and alerting is seen in all phases, and on virtually every pathway.</p>"
phase,Malware,"<p>The third commonly used vector is to deliver malware (including families such as Trickbot, or Qakbot) via email. These emails will either have an attachment or a link to download a malicious document &nbsp;usually in the form of a .doc or .xls. If this is opened and macros are allowed to execute, it is able to run its payload and attempt to load malware on the computer where the document was opened.</p> <p>ATT&amp;CK® Techniques</p> <ul> <li>T1566 Phishing</li> </ul>"
stage,Consolidation and preparation,"<p>Once the attacker has gained initial access to the network, they deploy further tools to control the devices they have compromised and use those tools to carry out the next steps of the attack.</p>                <p>The attackers goal is to gain access to all relevant devices in the environment including servers and workstations. To achieve this, the attackers will look for a path to gain Domain Administrator privileges as well as access to key infrastructure such as:</p>                <ul>                   <li>backup servers</li>                   <li>control panels for security systems such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) or Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)</li>                   <li>virtualisation platforms such as VMWare VCenter.</li>                   </ul>"
stage,Impact on target,"<p>Once the attacker has access to all relevant parts of the environment they will seek to extract sensitive information, destroy your organisations backups and finally encrypt your systems and data.</p>                   <p>In most cases data will be staged and exfiltrated slowly to avoid setting off Data Loss Prevention (DLP) or similar. Increased and recurring data uploads to unknown web services or common external file and data storage services such as Mega or Dropbox are common signs of data exfiltration. Exhaustive access to internal files and data stores by user accounts are also common signs.</p>                   <p>Look for users who are suddenly accessing data not associated with their role in bulk or privileged accounts accessing data rather than standard user accounts. As with the previous phase much of this activity has been seen to occur overnight or otherwise outside normal business hours in order to reduce the likelihood of detection and response.</p>                   <p>Once all desired data has been exfiltrated the attackers will seek to destroy your backups and then encrypt your data. At this point ransom notes or lock screens will be deployed to alert you to the ransomware attack and usually provide instructions about payment. These will often include instructions for payment to decrypt your data as well as a second payment to prevent the attacker from leaking or selling the data they have taken from your environment. They may also threaten further activity such as Distributed-Denial-of-Service (DDoS).</p>"
phase,Exploit vulnerability,"<p>Over the years we have seen a significant number of ransomware incidents that started with attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-exposed services. These have often been in remote access systems such as VPNs as well as other internet-exposed services such as Microsoft Exchange. WannaCry and NotPetya both exploited vulnerabilities in Windows SMB implementation to spread across the Internet.</p> <p>ATT&amp;CK® Techniques</p> <ul> <li>T1190 Exploit Public-Facing Application</li> </ul> <p>Technologies commonly exploited:</p> <ul> <li>SSL VPN (Pulse, Fortinet, Citrix, SonicWall and more)</li> <li>Microsoft Exchange</li> <li>Telerik UI based web interfaces</li> </ul>"
phase,Phishing,<p>In this pathway an attacker gains credentials to log in to remote access services such as a VPN or RDP server. These are commonly gained either through phishing or where passwords have been leaked in credential dumps and reused on those services. Some attackers also attempt brute-forcing of credentials to target weak and easy to guess usernames and passwords.</p> <p>ATT&amp;CK® Techniques</p> <ul> <li>T1566 Phishing</li> </ul> <p>Commonly attacked services:</p> <ul> <li>VPN</li> <li>RDP</li> </ul> <p>The first step in defending against these types of attacks is to identify and reduce the number of possible targets. Making sure you have accurate information with all services that can be accessed over the internet is fundamental to defending those services. In many organisations this exercise has uncovered previously unknown services or services which were thought to have been decommissioned.</p>

phase,Command and control,"<p>An important part of moving from a single compromised device to the entire network is establishing command and control to deploy and run additional tooling. C2 tools such as Cobalt Strike are used to deploy and run other tools such as Bloodhound and mimikatz, which are used in the next step. Other capabilities of the C2 tool may be used to carry out discovery of other devices on the network, establish persistence on devices and obfuscate these activities.</p> <p>ATT&amp;CK® Techniques</p> <ul> <li>T1573 Encrypted Channels</li> <li>T1078 Account Discovery</li> <li>T1018 Remote System Discovery</li> <li>T1046 Network Service Scanning</li> </ul>"
phase,Lateral movement,"<p>Lateral movement and Privilege escalation happen in tandem, with the attacker using C2 capabilities to deploy additional tools and identifying pathways to higher privileges. Once identified the attacker attempts to follow those paths combining steps of compromising credentials and using those credentials to access other devices on the network.</p> <p>Privilege escalation is often a combination of compromising credentials using tools such as mimikatz and exploiting vulnerabilities in operating systems and applications to gain administrative access to systems.</p> <p>Lateral movement is often carried out using tools native to the operating system of the devices such as PowerShell, RDP, and SMB. By using native tools the attacker reduces the likelihood of a defender noticing new tools that have been deployed in the network.</p>"

phase,Destroy backups,<p>Once all desired data has been exfiltrated the attackers will seek to destroy your backups and then encrypt your data. At this point ransom notes or lock screens will be deployed to alert you to the ransomware attack and usually provide instructions about payment. These will often include instructions for payment to decrypt your data as well as a second payment to prevent the attacker from leaking or selling the data they have taken from your environment.
