Yet, they quickly realize that before they can even assess compliance, they need to know their assets, and most asset inventories and CMDBs are a mess (if they even exist)!

We use Splunk to close the gap in two steps. First, we use Splunk® Enterpise Security to join information about assets from across as many datasets as needed, creating a lookup (or KV Store). Second, we use those lookups to dynamically generate eventtypes and tags to use in some Splunk premium apps.

Every compliance standard requires a functioning asset inventory, including SOX, HIPAA, FISMA, GDPR and many more! You need to know what’s there before securing what’s there.","Karthik Subramanian, Vice President, Technical Engagements, Qmulos Sam Harper, Director, Cloud Services, Qmulos","https://conf.splunk.com/watch/conf-online.html?search=SEC1154B","$Data exfiltration$;$Encrypt data$;$Internet-exposed service$",,,,,,"$Karthik Subramanian, Vice President, Technical Engagements, Qmulos$;$Sam Harper, Director, Cloud Services, Qmulos$",

This process is ideal during the development process for new detections, but it's cumbersome when all you want to do is to test an already existing detection. We solved this by using the Simulated Adversary Techniques Datasets for Splunk! We built a list of datasets from attacks generated by the attack_range. These datasets are broken down by platform, adversary groups, techniques, and tactics, according to the MITRE ATT&CK matrix.

To deploy zero trust effectively, three critical capabilities are needed. First, a robust data platform that supports real-time analytics with dynamic risk-based alerting. Second, the ability to respond to alerts in real time with rapid, automated orchestration. Third, contextual awareness of users and devices and their behavior patterns.
 
In this session, join Splunk Principal Security Architect Macy Cronkrite, Zscaler CISO Deepen Desai, and Zscaler's Scott Bullock, TME to learn:
 - the foundations of zero trust
 - how to implement a zero-trust architecture that actually works
 - how to create effective and streamlined security operations using telemetry, risk-based alerting, user behavioral analytics and orchestration

Traditional security postures usually take into account Virtual Private Networking (VPN) use cases, but those legacy Security Information Event Management (SIEM) rules may not have taken into account the full suite of remote access options, such as Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), or multifactor systems like Okta and RSA, which leave a potential security gap in end-to-end user activity and security event visibility. In the current work environment, customers are seeing these challenges exacerbated in a big way. In this talk we’re going to provide a methodology to assess where the visibility gaps are, incorporate new data sources into Splunk Enterprise Security (Correlations and Data Models), and communicate the new extended posture to your leadership.</p>

This segment of the conference will explore security related topics to include vulnerabilities, scalability and performance, with a special focus on Data Privacy, Compliance and Reputational Threat Management. If all things data and IT Security excite you, then this session is for you. Census executives Atri Kalluri and Zack Schwartz will provide a behind the scenes overview of the systems supporting the 2020 Decennial, including Splunk, and real world case studies on how the Census Bureau is adopting best practices across IT security and social media monitoring to ensure the security of respondent data.

And they tell us that there’s a consistent set of questions they must answer when investigating any attack scenario.
 
Yet, security data today is broken and unable to effectively answer those questions. It is either incomplete or storage and performance intensive.  Most teams don’t have the information necessary to properly answer the questions required to support their use cases; whether it be for threat hunting, investigations or supporting custom tools and models.
 
In this session, hear about real-world use cases where security teams use machine learning engines to derive unique security attributes and how it is embedded into security workflows.",,"https://conf.splunk.com/watch/conf-online.html?search=SECS2589","$Data exfiltration$;$Encrypt data$",,,,,,,

Traditional approaches to use case ideation focus on identifying new use cases based on the data already available to the security operations center. However, the threat landscape is constantly changing, and attackers are constantly getting more sophisticated. To detect these advanced threats, our use cases must be based on both business and threat context. In this session, we will share our approach to building innovative use cases based on real-world threats. Starting with industry-specific threat intelligence, we identify the threat actors and their specific tactics, techniques, and procedures. With these insights, we identify use cases relevant to the business, map them to both existing and new data sources, and prioritize implementation based on the specific threats.",,"https://conf.splunk.com/watch/conf-online.html?search=SECS2797","$Data exfiltration$;$Encrypt data$",,,,,,,

The speaker will draw on his experience as a founder of the first SOC-as-a-Service company that delivers managed security services using Splunk. 

Most industry analysts envision that the next generation of SOCs will leverage AI, Big Data, and the Cloud, but how far can automation take us and is the concept of an autonomous SOC really practical? How will the SOC of the Future address the global shortage of cyber professionals? How will the role of security analysts need to change? Will the SOC of the Future still need to be housed in dedicated physical facilities? 

The speaker will provide a blueprint of Proficio’s vision of the SOC of the Future using Splunk and provide a playbook for IT leaders and aspiring IT leaders on how to drive continuous improvement in productivity and measurable outcomes.",,"https://conf.splunk.com/watch/conf-online.html?search=SECS2839","$Data exfiltration$;$Encrypt data$;$Internet-exposed service$",,,,,,,

The MITRE ATT&CK Framework gives defenders a better map to “find evil,” but how can this framework be used to “know normal”?

Rick will discuss how knowing normal in a world of abnormal is harder than one thinks, and how addressing the actual root cause of evil can improve the technology industry as a whole.

See the demo showing how to identify disparate security risks, aggregate them, and send them to Splunk Phantom to remediate. 

The Splunk platform provides real-time, end-to-end visibility into your AWS environment to help you organize, display, and take action on your security alerts. AWS Security Hub makes this possible by aggregating security findings from AWS and third-party sources and exporting them to Splunk through a single point of integration—even as you continue to add new data sources. 

Security findings can then be sent to Splunk Phantom to automate responses, handling repetitive tasks to focus your attention on mission-critical decisions.  The integration between AWS and Splunk makes it easy for you to head off future security threats and free up your security personnel for higher value activities.",,"https://conf.splunk.com/watch/conf-online.html?search=SECS2979","$Data exfiltration$;$Encrypt data$;$Internet-exposed service$",,,,,,,

When considering how to create features for InfoSec purposes it is important to consider the context of the features and what their underlying meaning is. Common data science techniques such as feature hashing and one-hot encoding, while effective for certain tasks, often fall short when creating features for security related models. This talk expands upon feature encoders and scalers and the rationale used to arrive at these methods of encoding. It also goes into detail on the algorithms used to build these new encoders. Attendees to this presentation will come away with a new approach to encoding InfoSec features for machine learning that should increase the fidelity of their deep learning models.</p>
