Swimlane's Adaptive Response Action can create Swimlane cases pre-populated with Splunk alert and notable event data. 

Configuration

You are able to send alert data to up to 3 separate Swimlane instances with each action.  This is provided so you can
conveniently push to produciton, staging, and development instances with one action.

The global configuration is where you will define the connection info and credentials for your Swimlane instances.
1. In the top left corner of the Splunk interface, open the *app* dropdown menu and select the *Swimlane* app.
2. You will see the configuration page where you can define the host, username, and password for up to 3 Swimlane 
instances.

Alert Configuration

1. Once you have created an alert, go to the alert page and click *Edit* next to the *Actions* field.
2. At the bottom of the window, select *Add Actions* -> *Push Alerts to Swimlane*, then fill out the 
fields appropriately. Setup instructions for `Custom Field Mappings` and `Automappings` are in the next section 

Mapping configuration

For the initial setup, use `Automapping`.
1. In the Swimlane application, Create a JSON field with the *field key* `splunkrawjson` and a multi-line text field with the 
*field key* `splunkfieldlist`.  These two fields can be used to see the data being pushed to Swimlane.
2. Trigger the alert so that the action runs, then check Swimlane to make sure records were created in
the desired application.  if no records were created, check the logs (described in the **Logging** section
below) to debug.
3. Open one of the records that was created in Swimlane.  The fields in `splunkfieldlist` are the fields that are
available for mapping.  You can use `splunkrawjson` to see the value each field contains.
4. For each field that you want to push to Swimlane, either use `Automappings` or `Custom Field Mappings` as
described below.

If you select to use `automapping`, Splunk fields will populate a Swimlane field with the same field key if
it exists.  This is the preferred method of mapping since you can still display the info however you want in 
Swimlane by setting the field display name.

All Swimlane field types are supported and Splunk fields containing lists will be properly translated into
list type fields in Swimlane.

Logging

To find logs in the Splunk search, use the following search string:

index=_internal OR index=cim_modactions OR index=* source=""*push_alerts_to_swimlane_modalert.log""

To access the log file directly, it can be found at:

{Splunk root folder}/var/log/splunk/push_alerts_to_swimlane_modalert.log

If multiple executions happen concurrently, you can distinguish which log message belongs to which execution using the `pid`
logged in each message

General logs that Splunk generates can be found by going to *settings* -> *Alert actions*, then clicking on 
*View log events* for the *Push Events to Swimlane* action.","Password guessing Valid credentials","Swimlane App for Splunk",,"$it_operations_management$;$security_compliance$",,,,"$Password guessing$;$Valid credentials$",

The Cybereason AI Hunting Engine automatically asks a complex set of questions of data collected from all of your endpoints at a rate of 8 million calculations per second, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This means the solution is continuously hunting on your behalf by asking the same sorts of questions advanced security analysts would ask as they hunt for threats inside an environment.

QOMPLX event data is generated by streaming analysis of system logs and Active Directory authentication data to alert on some of the most devastating attack techniques involving lateral movement, privilege escalation, and credential compromise. The add-on augments existing data feeds with turnkey detections that include deterministic alerts (without false positives) for Golden Ticket, Silver Ticket, DCSync, and DCShadow attacks in near real-time, as well as heuristic-based alerts for Pass-the-Ticket, Pass-the-Hash, Overpass-the-Hash, Kerberoasting, and Skeleton Key attacks. Ingestion of additional event data is also supported, including alerts for other known attack techniques triggered by highly customizable rules built in the QOMPLX customer portal.

With 97% prediction accuracy and less than 0.01% false-positives, Augur provides unparalleled security and operational efficiency.

Adversary Profiling Means Better Protection
We are continually building and monitoring a pool of more than 10,000 adversary profiles. We identify new adversaries almost daily. Continuous surveillance means we know when they go live on day zero, and levels the playing field by removing the element of surprise. Adversary profiles also mean we can cover a much broader spectrum of potential threats from the same actor, as opposed to most TIPs which simply alert you of a specific threat when it's already knocking at your network door.

Automated Threat Response
The other radical thing Augur does is it generates Indicators of Attack associated with these future threats. Through our integrations with major security solutions, Augur is able to integrate blacklists into your firewalls, web proxies, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems, DNS servers, and Email gateways. Protecting you against malicious traffic before there is any risk. And when an attack origin is no longer malicious or there is a false positive, we automatically update our blacklists and adjust your security posture.

DomainTools enables Security Operations Centers (SOCs) and security analysts to take domain observables from their network and connect them with other active domains on the Internet. Those connections inform risk assessments, help profile attackers, guide online fraud investigations, and map cyber activity to attacker infrastructure.

With the influx in events per second rising, organizations need the ability to execute high-volume queries with improved response times. The DomainTools App for Splunk delivers, with enrichment at scale and drill-down details to add context. Leveraging the DomainTools Iris and Farsight DNSDB datasets, users have immediate access to dozens of attributes attached to every domain event in Splunk, efficiently delivering event enrichment at scale. 

Domain Monitoring

SOCs and Security Analysts can leverage the DomainTools Iris Detect product in Splunk to discover and watch newly registered domains associated with any terms their organization currently monitors (such as a brand or company name), and to monitor domains and append domains to your allowlist (list of trusted domains) from the Domain Investigation workflow. 

Predictive Risk Scoring

DomainTools Risk Score gives teams with emerging threat hunting skills an instant advantage in
helping to identify and optionally alert on Splunk events with suspicious domains they would have otherwise missed. Individual component scores give experienced hunters the tools they need to refine their alerts and precisely target their resources. DomainTools Risk Score, including Proximity and Threat Profile classifiers, is available in both key-value stores and Splunk indexes.

Proven Capability for Enterprise Organizations

DomainTools’ proven solution for Splunk includes a cloud-certified Splunk Application that deploys on Splunk search heads in both standalone and clustered configurations, with and without Splunk Enterprise Security. Event sources can be customized to match the unique requirements of each environment.

DomainTools Capabilities in Splunk

Reduce MTTD
• Bulk enrichment of domains with meaningful context
• At-a-glance alerting and reporting of malicious network traffic 
• Domain monitoring using DomainTools Iris Detect

Reduce MTTR
• Discover newly registered domains and further enable monitoring
• Create a Splunk ES notable event in case a high-risk domain is observed

As part of this law, US pharmaceutical supply chain stakeholders are required to confirm the authorized status of trading partners for transactions and information disclosures, even when there is no prior business relationship.

While larger Authorized Trading Partners (ATPs) have connectivity solutions in place, newer and smaller ATPs have not traditionally participated, including tens of thousands of dispensers. This complicates the path of the US pharmaceutical supply chain path to unlock the full potential of the interoperable system mandated by DSCSA.

XATP is a blockchain-backed framework for ATP authentication and enhanced verification in a real-world pharmacy with genuine drug packages. Using just a mobile phone, dispensers can submit supporting documentation to authenticate their identities, and scan 2D drug barcodes to submit drug verification requests to manufacturers.

Beyond Identity’s integration with Splunk feeds real-time data about the users and devices attempting to access your critical cloud resources across applications. When Splunk is integrated with Beyond Identity, security teams can ensure only secured devices and authorized users access company data. This stops all password-based attacks and definitively blocks lateral movement, feeding real-time risk signals into Splunk Enterprise Security to help improve threat detection and incident response.  
 
Beyond Identity continuously gathers data concerning the security posture of registered devices and forces their adherence to organizational device security policies.  Real-time risk-based authentication is informed by dozens of user and device risk signals during each login - enabling customers to enforce continuous, dynamic access control across the cloud applications and resources used to operate your organization. 


When Splunk is integrated with Beyond Identity, security teams get:

Strong Authentication Beyond Identity eliminates passwords as an authentication method and cryptographically binds user identity to the device via the secure TPM hardware on the device. This eliminates credential-based attacks and provides a very high assurance of the user identity before allowing access to critical SaaS resources. 

Granular Risk Signals and Immutable Logs Beyond Identity  captures granular device security posture data at the exact time of login such as operating system version,  security software state, and device type. Authentication event data is captured and aggregated in the Beyond Identity Administrative Portal for every login attempt. 

Identify Risky Users Beyond Identity stops unauthorized users and rejects devices from authentication if they do not meet an organization’s security requirements. Unauthorized devices that are not bound to a valid identity are stopped from authenticating. All authentication data is fed into Splunk and normalized to inform threat detection defense                                                                                                  

Event Mapping to CIM Beyond Identity injects data from every authentication attempt into Splunk’s Common Information Model to extract insights about the security posture of device-bound users, their authentication attempts, and the rejection of those who failed to satisfy device security requirements.

The process of implementing these configurations to a system can be complex and extraordinarily time consuming. In addition to remediating STIGs on all system components, you must be able to effectively report on and continuously monitor the compliance posture of your systems as they evolve over time. In a lot of cases, this process is managed with Excel spreadsheets and other tools that don’t allow you to get real insights into the data being captured in your compliance body of evidence. Worse yet, the manual nature of completing this work can be time consuming and very prone to human error.

KGI’s Atlas platform includes the STIG Compliance Application that is designed to assist with the entire process of putting systems into a compliant state, managing the compliance body of evidence, and reporting on the state of your system STIG compliance. This is accomplished by bringing your compliance data into the Atlas STIG Compliance App from your STIG checklists and vulnerability scanning systems. The Atlas STIG Compliance solution also includes an integration with Puppet that is capable of putting your RedHat systems into a compliant state and then sending real-time data about the current state of your systems over to Splunk. The makes the Atlas STIG Compliance a comprehensive solution that encompasses STIG Compliance reporting and remediation.

Key Features of Atlas STIG Compliance:
- Create and define systems that represent your environment or your accreditation boundaries.
- Visualize your compliance status at a system and system component level to better understand the quality of your systems.
- Automatically Ingests any STIG or SRG Checklist into Splunk.
- Track STIG Compliance posture over time to build an audit trail of your compliance activities.
- Easily update comments, finding details, status and more for your STIG Checklists within Splunk.
- Save time by bulk editing all of checklists at one time from the Splunk UI.
- Export your STIG Checklists from Splunk in the .ckl format so that they can be opened in the DISA STIG Viewer or imported into external systems.
- Allow teams to collaborate on STIG Compliance activities inside of the Splunk UI.
- Quickly audit your STIG checklists to identify checklists that have missing comments or finding details in your compliance body of evidence.
- Automatically identify discrepancies between your STIG Checklists and your vulnerability scans (SCAP and ACAS).
- Create custom POA&M reports that can be exported from Splunk.
- DISA STIG Templates are included in the App and are visible in the STIG Library feature

* Qmulos Apple Compliance is fully integrated with existing Qmulos products such as the Qmulos SCAP App for Splunk and Q-Compliance.

We have ensured that the macOS Compliance Scans, the primary driving force behind the Qmulos Apple Compliance integration, are compatible with the Qmulos SCAP App for Splunk. Seamless automation, reduced manual overhead, streamlined compliance lifecycle – all delivered through an easy-to-use graphic interface that doesn’t require your staff to be experts in macOS, Splunk, or compliance frameworks!

Additionally, macOS Compliance Scan rules are all mapped to NIST 800-53 controls, enabling control-specific granularity. The Qmulos SCAP App for Splunk provides rule-to-control mappings, SCAP benchmark and CCE uploads, and visualizations including a NIST 800-53 Score Card, Benchmarks Overview, and Enterprise Overview. Furthermore, macOS Compliance Scans are also integrated with Q-Compliance, and are visualized under the Security Scan Statistics panels which are supported by state-of-the-art Qmulos Alert Management functionality.

As enterprises continue to increasingly embrace Apple devices, maintaining a holistic understanding of the compliance state of macOS systems becomes a mission-critical objective. By leveraging Qmulos Apple Compliance and the macOS Security and Compliance Project, macOS systems can leverage all the operational compliance functionality and the frictionless compliance management experience delivered through the power of the Qmulos Converged Continuous Compliance™ platform.","Command and control Password guessing","Qmulos Apple Compliance",,"$endpoint$;$security_compliance$",,,,"$Command and control$;$Password guessing$",
