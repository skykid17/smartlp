imageCaption1 = This is the search assistant for normal Splunk searches. In this app, you will also find search assistants that help shortcut difficult search concepts, but for this one we're just using normal Splunk search.

imageCaption2 = We've tried to provide as much context as possible, so you can understand the impact of an example, how it works, adapt it to the particulars of your environment, and to handle the alerts that will be sent afterward.

imageCaption3 = In the boxes at the top, you can find high-level details, including the ever-important 'Data Source' links. You can follow the 'Data Source' links for several popular technologies, not just a list of technologies that provide those data sources. Also, there's detailed installation documentation that will help you get up and running!

imageCaption4 = Beneath the boxes there's other contextual data, including how to implement and respond, as well as, other examples and related Splunk capabilities!

imageCaption5 = The default shows the types of results you will see from a search. If you want to get more techie, use the "Show Search" to see or help implement the search string. You can either view the line-by-line search documentation or turn on "Advanced SPL Mode" to always see all the detail. (Don't worry, we'll save that setting.)

imageCaption6 = In Advanced SPL mode, you'll be able to see the pre-requisite checks that make sure you have the right data on boarded, get the "Open in Search" buttons, and be able to click "Schedule Alert" to save this search right from the app.

imageCaption7 = One last item for the overview, in the upper right-hand corner is a list of what searches are available for each example. Often, there's just a demo and a live version, but some examples might have three or four different versions.

You can either view the documented line-by-line search documentation, or you can turn on Advanced SPL Mode and always see all the detail. (Don't worry, we'll save that setting.)
imageCaption6 = To show what we mean when we described that this search automates the 'hard part' of detecting first time seen anomalies, we've highlighted the part of a search that we provided for a particular example, and the part that the dashboard provides. Much easier, right?
imageCaption7 = If you're in Advanced SPL mode, you will also be able to see the pre-requisite checks that make sure you have the right data onboard, you'll get the "Open in Search" buttons, and you'll even be able to click "Schedule Alert" to save this search right from the app.

imageCaption4 = There are four automated introspection steps that pulls a variety of data.
imageName5 = data_inventory-Slide5.png
imageCaption5 = For any sources or sourcetypes that are uncommon, you can tell the app what product it is.
imageName6 = data_inventory-Slide6.png
imageCaption6 = If you have a product that wasn't detected, or you aren't installing this app on your production search head, you can always manually add products by clicking Add Product. If you don't have data for a DSC, you can say No Data Present.

imageCaption1 = Splunk Security Essentials uses bookmarking to track what content is active in your environment, or to just help you remember what content you want to deploy.
imageName2 = search_mapping-Slide1.png
imageCaption2 = To make the process of recording your active content easier if you've installed this app on your production search head, it contains a Detection Introspection feature which walks you through marking active content.
imageName3 = search_mapping-Slide2.png
imageCaption3 = This introspection will pull a list of all of your enabled local scheduled searches that have an action associated with them. It will also automatically enable any directly enabled ES, ESCU, or SSE content.
imageName4 = search_mapping-Slide3.png
imageCaption4 = For most content, the introspection will provide you with the option to indicate that a search is not a security detection, search through all of the out-of-the-box content contained in the app, or create new custom content in the app. Any of these will help you accurately map data source, MITRE, and other metadata for your content.
imageName5 = search_mapping-Slide4.png
imageCaption5 = Splunk Security Essentials includes a search engine to help you search the app and map any detection search to all of the out-of-the-box content.
imageName6 = search_mapping-Slide5.png

imageName1 = es_risk-Slide0.png
imageCaption1 = The Analyze ES Risk Attributions dashboard helps you understand the data provided by the Splunk Enterprise Security's Risk Analysis Framework. Most users will arrive here via a drilldown from a user or system, populating that user/system in the search box and focusing the analysis accordingly. That said, you can enter any search string to use the dashboard to analyze a network or even your entire organization.
imageName2 = es_risk-Slide1.png
imageCaption2 = Customers who get the most value out of ES Risk often use MITRE ATT&CK, which is why we provide a series of system-wide ATT&CK metrics on the left, and then on the number of hits per tactic for your provided user/system.
imageName3 = es_risk-Slide2.png
imageCaption3 = Beneath that, you will find a customized MITRE ATT&CK Matrix for this user/system, showing you which techniques have fired for the data you've selected in the search.
imageName4 = es_risk-Slide3.png
imageCaption4 = Aggregating risk attributions is the core strength of this dashboard. You'll next see a series of charts that aggregate risk by various metrics.

imageName3 = manage_bookmarks-Slide3.png
imageCaption3 = There are multiple export options. Most are very straightforward.
imageName4 = manage_bookmarks-Slide4.png

imageName5 = manage_bookmarks-Slide5.png
imageCaption5 = Print-to-PDF works by generating a printable page, and letting you save as PDF via your browser. This works best in Chrome.
