Microsoft System Center Operations Manager 2019 Microsoft System Center Operations Manager 2022 

The Splunk Add-on for Microsoft SCOM allows a Splunk software administrator to collect data from Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM). The add-on polls data from 54 built-in objects in SCOM, including alerts, events, tasks, network devices, management and performance settings. This add-on provides the inputs and CIM-compatible knowledge to use with other Splunk apps, such as Splunk Enterprise Security and the Splunk App for PCI Compliance and Splunk IT Service Intelligence. 

This add-on uses the selected System Center Operations Manager scriptlets to collect the data. Since the scriptlets may not be performant enough for larger infrastructures, Splunk also provides a number of specialized SQL queries for collecting events, alerts and performance data.
