The Splunk Add-on for Microsoft IIS allows a Splunk software administrator to collect website activity data in the W3C log file format from Microsoft IIS servers. The Add-on only supports the W3C log file format. It can ingest W3C-compliant log files generated by standard logging as well as advanced logging in IIS. The add-on can also be used to list the global modules installed in the IIS Servers using the Get-WebGlobalModule command.

This add-on provides the inputs and CIM-compatible knowledge to use with other Splunk apps, such as Splunk Enterprise Security and the Splunk App for PCI Compliance.
