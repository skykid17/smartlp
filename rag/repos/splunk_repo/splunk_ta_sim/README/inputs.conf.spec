# This file contains possible settings you can use to configure SIM Modular inputs.
#
# There is an inputs.conf in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/splunk_ta_sim/default To set custom
# configurations, place an inputs.conf in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/splunk_ta_sim/local.
# You must restart SIM Add-on to enable new configurations.
#
# To learn more about configuration files (including precedence), see the
# documentation located at
# https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SIMAddon/1.0.0/Install/ModInput

####
# GLOBAL SETTINGS
####
# Use the [default] stanza to define any global settings.
#   * You can also define global settings outside of any stanza, at the top of
#     the file.
#   * Each conf file should have at most one default stanza. If there are
#     multiple default stanzas, settings are combined. In the case of
#     multiple definitions of the same setting, the last definition in the
#     file wins.
#   * If a setting is defined at both the global level and in a specific
#     stanza, the value in the specific stanza takes precedence.
