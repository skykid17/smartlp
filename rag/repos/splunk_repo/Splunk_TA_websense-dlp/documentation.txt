The Splunk Add-on for Websense DLP allows a Splunk software administrator to collect logs from Websense DLP (also known as Triton AP-Endpoint DLP) appliances using syslog. After the Splunk platform indexes the events, you can analyze the data using the prebuilt dashboard panels included with the add-on. This add-on provides the inputs and CIM-compatible knowledge to use with other Splunk apps, such as Splunk Enterprise Security and the Splunk App for PCI Compliance.
