The Splunk Add-on for Tomcat allows a Splunk software administrator to pull Tomcat logs from a local Tomcat server and Tomcat performance data from local and remote Tomcat servers. This add-on provides the inputs and CIM-compatible knowledge to use with other Splunk apps, such as Splunk Enterprise Security, the Splunk App for PCI Compliance, and Splunk IT Service Intelligence. 

You must also install and configure the Splunk Add-on for Java Management Extensions (JMX) if you want to collect Tomcat performance data provided by MBean attributes.
