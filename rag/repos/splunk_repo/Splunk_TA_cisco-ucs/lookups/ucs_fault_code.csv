F0832,"This fault occurs when at least one logical interface is misconfigured. This can happen when upgrading to a different type or series of fabric interconnect or when importing a configuration.

The configuration must meet the following constraints:
   - The first Fibre Channel port must be an odd port number. This constraint cannot be violated when upgrading from a Cisco UCS 6100 series fabric interconnect to a Cisco UCS 6200 series fabric interconnect.
  - All FC ports must be configured contiguously with intervening unconfigured FC ports. This can happen during an upgrade from a Cisco UCS 6100 series fabric interconnect when you import the configuration from a Cisco UCS 6100 series fabric interconnect configuration into a Cisco UCS 6200 series fabric interconnect. For example, the Cisco UCS 6100 series fabric interconnect has an FC expansion module with ports FC2/1 through FC2/6 configured. When you import that configuration into a Cisco UCS 6200 series fabric interconnect, FC ports 2/7 through 2/16 remain unconfigured. You can correct this problem by configuring the missing FC ports.
  - Ethernet and FC port ranges cannot overlap. This can happen when upgrading from a Cisco UCS 6100 series fabric interconnect to a Cisco UCS 6200 series fabric interconnect. For example, some Cisco UCS 6100 expansion modules have FC and Ethernet ports with the same ID, such as FC port 2/1 and Ethernet port 2/1.
  - There must be at most one logical port per fabric interconnect ID/module ID/port ID. For example, a port cannot be configured as both Ethernet and FC. This can happen during an upgrade from a Cisco UCS 6100 series fabric interconnect. For example, some Cisco UCS 6100 expansion modules have FC and Ethernet ports with the same ID, such as FC port 2/1 and Ethernet port 2/1.
  - Within a module, the port IDs of Ethernet ports must be lower than the smallest FC port ID. This means that all Ethernet ports must be on the left and all FC ports on the right. This can happen during an upgrade from a Cisco UCS 6140 fabric interconnect with 40 ports on the fixed module to a Cisco UCS 6248 fabric interconnect with 32 ports on the fixed module. For example, if the Cisco UCS 6248 is initially configured with Ethernet ports 1/1 through 1/16 and FC ports 1/17 through 1/32, and you import a a configuration from the Cisco UCS 6140 with Ethernet ports 1/1 through 1/32 unconfigured and Ethernet ports 1/33 through 1/40, the resulting configuration is Ethernet 1/1 through 1/16, FC 1/17 through 1/32, and Ethernet 1/33 through 1/40. This is not a valid configuration. You must delete ports 1/33 through 1/40 to correct the configuration.
  - A non-unified Ethernet port cannot be configured as an FC port. Please note the following:   - This constraint cannot be violated when upgrading from a Cisco UCS 6100 series fabric interconnect to a Cisco UCS 6200 series fabric interconnect.
  - This constraint can be violated when downgrading from a Cisco UCS 6200 series fabric interconnect to a Cisco UCS 6100 series fabric interconnect.
  - This constraint can be violated when pre-provisioning a port on a Cisco UCS 6100 series fabric interconnect and then inserting an expansion module that does not match the requirement.
