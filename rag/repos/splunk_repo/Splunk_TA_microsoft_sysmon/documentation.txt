The Splunk Add-on for Sysmon allows a Splunk software administrator to create a Splunk software data input and CIM-compliant field extractions for Microsoft Sysmon.

The Splunk Add-on for Sysmon is not the same as the Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Sysmon, which is a community-supported add-on. The community-supported add-on will remain available, but since the Splunk Add-on for Sysmon contains enhancements to events field mappings and Common Information Model (CIM) changes, you should migrate your Microsoft Sysmon data ingestion from the Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Sysmon to the Splunk Add-on for Sysmon.

For information on the differences in the technical support for different Splunkbase app or add-ons, see the Support content topic in the Splunk Developer Guide.
