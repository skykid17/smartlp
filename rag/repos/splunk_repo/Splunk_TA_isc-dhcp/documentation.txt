The Splunk Add-on for ISC DHCP allows a Splunk software administrator to collect the DHCP access log in syslog format from the ISC DHCP platform, using file monitoring. This add-on provides the CIM-compatible knowledge to use with other Splunk apps, such as Splunk Enterprise Security and the Splunk App for PCI Compliance.
